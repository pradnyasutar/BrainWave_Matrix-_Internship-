# Task 1: Sales Data Analysis for a Commercial Store
In this task, I analyzed sales data from a commercial store to derive actionable insights.
Key Steps:

* Loaded the sales data from a CSV file (supermarket_sales.csv).
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset.
* Used Python libraries like pandas and numpy for data manipulation.

## Conclusion:
The sales data analysis successfully identified key insights into the store's performance. Key findings include:

* High-performing products and categories driving the most revenue.
* Seasonal and temporal sales trends, helping identify peak periods.
* Potential areas for improvement in inventory management and marketing strategies.
* This analysis can assist the store's management in making informed decisions to optimize sales and customer satisfaction.

# Task 2: Social Media Sentiment Analysis
In this task, I analyzed social media data to understand public sentiment toward specific topics or products.
Key Steps:

* Preprocessed the text data using NLP techniques such as removing stopwords and special characters, and applying TextBlob for sentiment scoring.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis on a dataset (brandandproductemotions.csv) containing tweets and sentiments.
* Implemented machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to classify sentiments and evaluated model performance.

## Conclusion:
The sentiment analysis of social media data provided valuable insights into public perception of brands and products. Key results include:

* Identification of predominant sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) across various topics.
* Visualization of sentiment trends over time, aiding in understanding customer engagement and feedback.
* Development of a sentiment classification model with promising accuracy, which can be further enhanced for deployment.
* This project showcases the power of NLP and machine learning in deriving actionable insights from unstructured social media data.
